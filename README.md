Comprehensive Data Management for Microscopy Research Datasets

This solution was built as part of the ANDS funded Monash ARDC-EIF Comprehensive Data Management for Microscopy Research Datasets Project. This project aimed to develop software solutions that:

    Capture data and metadata from research instruments and devices
    Make available and automate feeds of data collection descriptions
    Enable data/metadata management and sharing
    Facilitate the re-use and discovery of data
    Recognise the need to facilitate the overall data stream/s from Monash to the RDA which include collections with related party and activity descriptions in compliance with the requirements set out in the ANDS Minimum Metadata Contents for RIF-CS 

This solution allows the Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences to generate and capture experimental information and raw data from optical microscopy instruments in a centralised location, rather than the current practise of capturing this on researchers lab-notes and personal disks. This approach will establish a concept for the mandatory annotation of digital imaging data to maximise the use, re-use and distribution of experimental information within the scientific community.
Data Type:
Microscopy Image:

    Optical and fluorescence microscopy
    Confocal microscopy
    Live cell imaging
    Transmission electron microscopy
    Scanning electron microscopy
    Cryo methods for tissue preparation
    Digital imaging and image analysis 

High Level Software Functionality

The Open Microscopy Environment, OMERO was selected for its data management and sharing capability which includes:

    Importing Files
    Organising Files
    Viewing Files
    Analysing Files
    Exporting Files
    Sharing Files through groups 

Sharing capability of OMERO client is further extended by creating an interface from the OMERO Insight client to Research Data Australia.

Check out the OMERO Insight client customized version for ANDS funded Monash ARDC-EIF project from github

Check out the metadata registration server components from the source section.

This project is supported by the Australian National Data Service (ANDS). ANDS is supported by the Australian Government through the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy Program and the Education Investment Fund (EIF) Super Science Initiative.
